/**
 * Template Method is a behavioral design pattern.
 * 
 * Perhaps you have encoutered it many times already. The idea is to let subclasses
 * of this abstract template "finish" the behavior of an algorithm.
 * 
 * A.k.a the "Hollywood principle" : "" Don't call us, we call you. ""
 * This class is not called by subclasses but the inverse.
 * How ? With abstraction of course. 
 * 
 * In other words, this is a skeleton of algorithm, well-suited for framework 
 * libraries. The user has just to implement one method and the superclass do
 * the job.
 * 
 * It is an easy way to decouple concrete classes and reduce copy-paste, 
 * that's why you'll find it everywhere.
