# Fluent Interface

## Purpose

To write code that is easy readable just like sentences in a natural language (like English).

## Examples

* Doctrine2's QueryBuilder works something like that example class below
* PHPUnit uses fluent interfaces to build mock objects
* Yii Framework: CDbCommand and CActiveRecord use this pattern, too
