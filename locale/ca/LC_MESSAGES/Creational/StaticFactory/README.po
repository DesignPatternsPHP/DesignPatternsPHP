"Similar to the AbstractFactory, this pattern is used to create series of "
"related or dependent objects. The difference between this and the abstract "
"factory pattern is that the static factory pattern uses just one static "
"method to create all types of objects it can create. It is usually named "
"``factory`` or ``build``."
