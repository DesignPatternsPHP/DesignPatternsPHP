"A Data Mapper, is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional transfer "
"of data between a persistent data store (often a relational database) and an"
" in memory data representation (the domain layer). The goal of the pattern "
"is to keep the in memory representation and the persistent data store "
"independent of each other and the data mapper itself. The layer is composed "
"of one or more mappers (or Data Access Objects), performing the data "
"transfer. Mapper implementations vary in scope. Generic mappers will handle "
"many different domain entity types, dedicated mappers will handle one or a "
"few."
