"Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like "
"interface for accessing domain objects. Repository encapsulates the set of "
"objects persisted in a data store and the operations performed over them, "
"providing a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer. Repository "
"also supports the objective of achieving a clean separation and one-way "
"dependency between the domain and data mapping layers."
