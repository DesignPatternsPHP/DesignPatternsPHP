"Demonstrate the Delegator pattern, where an object, instead of performing "
"one of its stated tasks, delegates that task to an associated helper object."
" In this case TeamLead professes to writeCode and Usage uses this, while "
"TeamLead delegates writeCode to JuniorDeveloper's writeBadCode function. "
"This inverts the responsibility so that Usage is unknowingly executing "
"writeBadCode."
