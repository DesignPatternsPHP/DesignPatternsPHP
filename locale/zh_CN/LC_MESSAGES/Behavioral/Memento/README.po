"similar states in different snapshots. That means the state can be extracted"
" as the independent clone. Any object stored in the Memento should be *a "

#~ "The memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, a "
#~ "caretaker and a memento. The originator is some object that has an internal "
#~ "state. The caretaker is going to do something to the originator, but wants "
#~ "to be able to undo the change. The caretaker first asks the originator for a"
#~ " memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations)"
#~ " it was going to do. To roll back to the state before the operations, it "
#~ "returns the memento object to the originator. The memento object itself is "
#~ "an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change). "
#~ "When using this pattern, care should be taken if the originator may change "
#~ "other objects or resources - the memento pattern operates on a single "
#~ "object."
