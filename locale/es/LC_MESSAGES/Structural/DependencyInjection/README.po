#: ../../Structural/DependencyInjection/README.rst:13
msgid ""
"Configuration gets injected and ``Connection`` will get all that it needs "
"from ``$config``. Without DI, the configuration would be created directly in"
" ``Connection``, which is not very good for testing and extending "
"``Connection``."

"Notice we are following Inversion of control principle in ``Connection`` by "
"asking ``$config`` to implement ``Parameters`` interface. This decouples our"
" components. We don't care where the source of information comes from, we "
"only care that ``$config`` has certain methods to retrieve that information."
" Read more about Inversion of control `here "

"The Doctrine2 ORM uses dependency injection e.g. for configuration that is "
"injected into a ``Connection`` object. For testing purposes, one can easily "
"create a mock object of the configuration and inject that into the "
"``Connection`` object"

"Symfony and Zend Framework 2 already have containers for DI that create "
"objects via a configuration array and inject them where needed (i.e. in "
"Controllers)"
