"The **object pool pattern** is a software creational design pattern that "
"uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use – a \"pool\" – rather "
"than allocating and destroying them on demand. A client of the pool will "
"request an object from the pool and perform operations on the returned "
"object. When the client has finished, it returns the object, which is a "
"specific type of factory object, to the pool rather than destroying it."

"Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost in situations "
"where the cost of initializing a class instance is high, the rate of "
"instantiation of a class is high, and the number of instances in use at "
"any one time is low. The pooled object is obtained in predictable time "
"when creation of the new objects (especially over network) may take "
"variable time."

"However these benefits are mostly true for objects that are expensive "
"with respect to time, such as database connections, socket connections, "
"threads and large graphic objects like fonts or bitmaps. In certain "
"situations, simple object pooling (that hold no external resources, but "
"only occupy memory) may not be efficient and could decrease performance."
