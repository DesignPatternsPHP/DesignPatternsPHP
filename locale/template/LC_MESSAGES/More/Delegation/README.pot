"Demonstrate the Delegator pattern, where an object, instead of performing one "
"of its stated tasks, delegates that task to an associated helper object. In "
"this case TeamLead professes to writeCode and Usage uses this, while TeamLead "
"delegates writeCode to JuniorDeveloper's writeBadCode function. This inverts "
"the responsibility so that Usage is unknowingly executing writeBadCode."
