"We have an Invoker and a Receiver. This pattern uses a \"Command\" to "
"delegate the method call against the Receiver and presents the same "
"method \"execute\". Therefore, the Invoker just knows to call \"execute\" to "
"process the Command of the client. The Receiver is decoupled from the "
"Invoker."

#: ../../Behavioral/Command/README.rst:15

"The second aspect of this pattern is the undo(), which undoes the method "
"execute(). Command can also be aggregated to combine more complex "
"commands with minimum copy-paste and relying on composition over "
"inheritance."
