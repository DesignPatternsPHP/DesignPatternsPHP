"It provides the ability to restore an object to it's previous state (undo "
"via rollback) or to gain access to state of the object, without revealing "
"it's implementation (i.e., the object is not required to have a function "
"to return the current state)."

"The memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the Originator, a "
"Caretaker and a Memento."

msgid ""
"Memento – an object that *contains a concrete unique snapshot of state* of "
"any object or resource: string, number, array, an instance of class and so on. "
"The uniqueness in this case does not imply the prohibition existence of similar "
"states in different snapshots. That means the state can be extracted as "
"the independent clone. Any object stored in the Memento should be "
"*a full copy of the original object rather than a reference* to the original "
"object. The Memento object is a \"opaque object\" (the object that no one can "
"or should change)."

#: ../../Behavioral/Memento/README.rst:24
msgid ""
"Originator – it is an object that contains the *actual state of an external "
"object is strictly specified type*. Originator is able to create a unique "
"copy of this state and return it wrapped in a Memento. The Originator does "
"not know the history of changes. You can set a concrete state to Originator "
"from the outside, which will be considered as actual. The Originator must "
"make sure that given state corresponds the allowed type of object. Originator "
"may (but not should) have any methods, but they *they can't make changes to "
"the saved object state*."

#: ../../Behavioral/Memento/README.rst:33
msgid ""
"Caretaker *controls the states history*. He may make changes to an object; "
"take a decision to save the state of an external object in the Originator; "
"ask from the Originator snapshot of the current state; or set the Originator "
"state to equivalence with some snapshot from history."
