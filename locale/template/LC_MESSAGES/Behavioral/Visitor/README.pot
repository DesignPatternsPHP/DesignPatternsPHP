msgid ""
"The Visitor Pattern lets you outsource operations on objects to other "
"objects. The main reason to do this is to keep a separation of concerns. "
"But classes have to define a contract to allow visitors (the "
"``Role::accept`` method in the example)."

msgid ""
"The contract is an abstract class but you can have also a clean "
"interface. In that case, each Visitor has to choose itself which method "
"to invoke on the visitor."
