#: ../../Structural/DependencyInjection/README.rst:13
msgid ""
"DatabaseConfiguration gets injected and ``DatabaseConnection`` will get all that it "
"needs from ``$config``. Without DI, the configuration would be created "
"directly in ``DatabaseConnection``, which is not very good for testing and "
"extending it."

"The Doctrine2 ORM uses dependency injection e.g. for configuration "
"that is injected into a ``Connection`` object. For testing purposes, "
"one can easily create a mock object of the configuration and inject "
"that into the ``Connection`` object"

"Symfony and Zend Framework 2 already have containers for DI that "
