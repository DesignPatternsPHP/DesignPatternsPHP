"The primary goal of a Facade Pattern is not to avoid you to read the "
"manual of a complex API. It's only a side-effect. The first goal is to "
"reduce coupling and follow the Law of Demeter."

"A Facade is meant to decouple a client and a sub-system by embedding "
"many (but sometimes just one) interface, and of course to reduce "
"complexity."

"That's why a good facade has no ``new`` in it. If there are multiple "
"creations for each method, it is not a Facade, it's a Builder or a "
"[Abstract\|Static\|Simple] Factory [Method]."

"The best facade has no ``new`` and a constructor with "
"interface-type-hinted parameters. If you need creation of new instances, "
"use a Factory as argument."
