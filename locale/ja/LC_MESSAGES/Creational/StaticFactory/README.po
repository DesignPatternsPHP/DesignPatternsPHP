"Similar to the AbstractFactory, this pattern is used to create series of "
"related or dependent objects. The difference between this and the "
"abstract factory pattern is that the static factory pattern uses just one"
" static method to create all types of objects it can create. It is "
"usually named ``factory`` or ``build``."
