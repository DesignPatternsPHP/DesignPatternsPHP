"Service Locator is considered for some people an anti-pattern. It "
"violates the Dependency Inversion principle. Service Locator hides class'"
" dependencies instead of exposing them as you would do using the "
"Dependency Injection. In case of changes of those dependencies you risk "
"to break the functionality of classes which are using them, making your "
"system difficult to maintain."

#: ../../More/ServiceLocator/README.rst:12
msgid ""
"To implement a loosely coupled architecture in order to get better "
"testable, maintainable and extendable code. DI pattern and Service "
"Locator pattern are an implementation of the Inverse of Control pattern."

msgid ""
"With ``ServiceLocator`` you can register a service for a given interface."
" By using the interface you can retrieve the service and use it in the "
"classes of the application without knowing its implementation. You can "
"configure and inject the Service Locator object on bootstrap."
