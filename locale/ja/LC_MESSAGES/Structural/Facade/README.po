"A Facade is meant to decouple a client and a sub-system by embedding many"
" (but sometimes just one) interface, and of course to reduce complexity."

"creations for each method, it is not a Facade, it's a Builder or a "
"[Abstract\\|Static\\|Simple] Factory [Method]."

"The best facade has no ``new`` and a constructor with interface-type-"
