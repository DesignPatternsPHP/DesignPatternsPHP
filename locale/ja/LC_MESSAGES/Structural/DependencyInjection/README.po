"``DatabaseConfiguration`` gets injected and ``DatabaseConnection`` will "
"get all that it needs from ``$config``. Without DI, the configuration "
"would be created directly in ``DatabaseConnection``, which is not very "
"good for testing and extending it."

"The Doctrine2 ORM uses dependency injection e.g. for configuration that "
"is injected into a ``Connection`` object. For testing purposes, one can "
"easily create a mock object of the configuration and inject that into the"
" ``Connection`` object"

"many frameworks already have containers for DI that create objects via a "
