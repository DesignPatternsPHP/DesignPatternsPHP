"A Data Mapper, is a Data Access Layer that performs bidirectional "
"transfer of data between a persistent data store (often a relational "
"database) and an in memory data representation (the domain layer). The "
"goal of the pattern is to keep the in memory representation and the "
"persistent data store independent of each other and the data mapper "
"itself. The layer is composed of one or more mappers (or Data Access "
"Objects), performing the data transfer. Mapper implementations vary in "
"scope. Generic mappers will handle many different domain entity types, "
"dedicated mappers will handle one or a few."
