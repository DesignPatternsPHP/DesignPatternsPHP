"Demonstrate the Delegator pattern, where an object, instead of performing"
" one of its stated tasks, delegates that task to an associated helper "
"object. In this case TeamLead professes to writeCode and Usage uses this,"
" while TeamLead delegates writeCode to JuniorDeveloper's writeBadCode "
"function. This inverts the responsibility so that Usage is unknowingly "
"executing writeBadCode."
