 * Visitor Pattern
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The Visitor Pattern lets you outsource operations on objects to other objects. The main reason to do this is to keep
 * a seperation of concerns. But classes have to define an contract to allow visitors (the "accept" method in the example below).
 * 
 * The contract is an abstract class but you can have also a clean interface. 
 * In that case, each Visitee has to choose itself which method to invoke on the visitor.
