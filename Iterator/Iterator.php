/**
 * iterator pattern
 *
 * Purpose:
 * to make an object iterable
 *
 * Examples:
 * - to process a file line by line by just running over all lines (which have an object representation) for a file
 *   (which of course is an object, too)
 *
 * Note:
 * Standard PHP Library (SPL) defines an interface Iterator which is best suited for this!
 * Often you would want to implement the Countable interface too, to allow count($object) on your iterable object
 *
 * THIS EXAMPLE ALSO APPLIES THE COMPOSITE PATTERN
