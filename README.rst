This is a collection of known `design patterns`_ and some sample code how
to implement them in PHP. Every pattern has a small list of examples.

I think the problem with patterns is that often people do know them but
don't know when to apply which.

Patterns
--------

The patterns can be structured in roughly three different categories.
Please click on **the title of every pattern's page** for a full explanation of the pattern on Wikipedia.
