# Static Factory

## Purpose

Similar to the AbstractFactory, this pattern is used to create series of related or dependent objects.
The difference between this and the abstract factory pattern is that the static factory pattern uses just one static
method to create all types of objects it can create. It is usually named `factory` or `build`.

## Examples

* Zend Framework: `Zend_Cache_Backend` or `_Frontend` use a factory method create cache backends or frontends
