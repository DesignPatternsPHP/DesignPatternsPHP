Repository
==========

Purpose
-------

Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a
collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. Repository
encapsulates the set of objects persisted in a data store and the
operations performed over them, providing a more object-oriented view of
the persistence layer. Repository also supports the objective of
achieving a clean separation and one-way dependency between the domain
and data mapping layers.

Examples
--------

-  Doctrine 2 ORM: there is Repository that mediates between Entity and
   DBAL and contains methods to retrieve objects
-  Laravel Framework
