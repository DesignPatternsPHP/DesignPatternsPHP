`Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)`__
================================

The Entity–attribute–value (EAV) pattern in order to implement EAV model with PHP.

Purpose
-------

The Entity–attribute–value (EAV) model is a data model to describe entities
where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used
to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply
to a given entity is relatively modest.
