/**
 * Dependency Injection
 *
 * Purpose:
 * to implement a loosely coupled architecture in order to get better testable, maintainable and extendable code
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - the Doctrine2 ORM uses dependency injection e.g. for Configuration that is injected into a Connection object. for
 *   testing purposes, one can easily create a mock object of the configuration and inject that into the connection
 *   object
 * - Symfony and Zend Framework 2 already have containers for DI that create objects via a configuration array and
 *   inject them where needed (i.e. in Controllers)
 *
