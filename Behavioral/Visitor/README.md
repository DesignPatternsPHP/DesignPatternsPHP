# Visitor

## Purpose

The Visitor Pattern lets you outsource operations on objects to other objects. The main reason to do this is to keep a separation of concerns.
But classes have to define a contract to allow visitors (the `Role::accept` method in the example).

The contract is an abstract class but you can have also a clean interface. In that case, each Visitor has to choose itself which method to invoke on the visitor.
