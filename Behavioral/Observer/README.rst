`Observer`__
============

Purpose
-------

To implement a publish/subscribe behaviour to an object, whenever a
"Subject" object changes its state, the attached "Observers" will be
notified. It is used to shorten the amount of coupled objects and uses
loose coupling instead.

Examples
--------

-  a message queue system is observed to show the progress of a job in a
   GUI

Note
----

PHP already defines two interfaces that can help to implement this
pattern: SplObserver and SplSubject.
