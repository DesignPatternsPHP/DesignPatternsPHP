`Null Object`__
===============

Purpose
-------

NullObject is not a GoF design pattern but a schema which appears
frequently enough to be considered a pattern. It has the following
benefits:

-  Client code is simplified
-  Reduces the chance of null pointer exceptions
-  Fewer conditionals require less test cases

Methods that return an object or null should instead return an object or
``NullObject``. ``NullObject``\ s simplify boilerplate code such as
``if (!is_null($obj)) { $obj->callSomething(); }`` to just
``$obj->callSomething();`` by eliminating the conditional check in
client code.

Examples
--------

- Null logger or null output to preserve a standard way of interaction between objects, even if the shouldn't do anything
-  null handler in a Chain of Responsibilities pattern
-  null command in a Command pattern
