## Purpose

To translate one interface for a class into a compatible interface. An adapter allows classes to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces by providing it's interface to clients while using the original interface.

## Examples

* DB Client libraries adapter
* using multiple different webservices and adapters normalize data so that the outcome is the same for all
