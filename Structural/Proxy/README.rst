`Proxy`__
=========

Purpose
-------

To interface to anything that is expensive or impossible to duplicate.

Examples
--------

-  Doctrine2 uses proxies to implement framework magic (e.g. lazy
   initialization) in them, while the user still works with his own
   entity classes and will never use nor touch the proxies
