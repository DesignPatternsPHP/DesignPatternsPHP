`Flyweight`__
=============

Purpose
-------

To minimise memory usage, a Flyweight shares as much as possible memory with similar objects. It
is needed when a large amount of objects is used that don't differ much in state. A common practice is
to hold state in external data structures and pass them to the flyweight object when needed.
